## Running Locally

You can easily run Nexus AI on your local computer.

1. **Clone the code repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhangyao421/nexus-ai.git
```

2. **Enter the project directory:**
```bash
cd nexus-ai
```

3. **Start a local server:**
Due to browser security restrictions, you need to access `index.html` through a local server instead of opening it directly in the file browser. The easiest way is:

**Method 1: Use the Live Server plugin for VS Code**
* If you use Visual Studio Code, install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin.
* Open the project folder in VS Code, then right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".

**Method 2: Using Python**
* If Python is installed on your computer, simply run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server

# Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
* Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The AI chat feature requires an API key to work.

1. Open the `chat/index.html` file.

2. Find the `<script>` section at the bottom of the file.

3. Modify the `API_KEY` variable and fill it with your valid key:

```javascript
// API Key
const API_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxx'; // <-- Replace this with your key
```
*Note: The code already includes your provided key. If you need to change it, please modify this line. *
